# AuthArmor Javascript Client-Side SDK UI

AuthArmor provides a SaaS solution to authenticate your users exclusively using passwordless authentication methods such as WebAuthn, magic links and the proprietary AuthArmor mobile app.

This package provides a flexible and full-featured UI around the [autharmor-sdk](https://github.com/AuthArmor/autharmor-jsclient-sdk) package. It provides a Web Components-based form component that can be used to log in and register users and an interactive client interface that can be used for imperatively launching login or registration requests (such as for two-factor authentication).

This package is designed to work together with [autharmor-sdk](https://github.com/AuthArmor/autharmor-jsclient-sdk). A knowledge of how that package works will be helpful in using this package.

## Installation

This package is available on the NPM registry as `@autharmor/ui`. You must have the `@autharmor/sdk` package to use it. Use your project's package manager to install both the packages:

```sh
# NPM
npm install @autharmor/sdk @autharmor/ui

# PNPM
pnpm add @autharmor/sdk @autharmor/ui

# Yarn
yarn add @autharmor/sdk @autharmor/ui
```
